# Portfolio

## Description

I'm thrilled to showcase my latest projectâ€”a stunning portfolio created using Next.js, Tailwind CSS, and my first-ever venture into the world of Three.js! It showcases my web development skills and incorporates 3D elements. The portfolio is designed to be visually appealing, responsive, and optimized for performance.

Next.js was chosen because of its exceptional performance, scalability, and smooth integration with React. Moreover, Next.js's dynamic routing system allowed me to organize my project efficiently and maintain clean code architecture.

For me, the introduction of Three.js was an interesting learning experience. I added immersive 3D features to my portfolio by utilizing this powerful JavaScript package. I built dynamic animations, provided fascinating visual effects, and showcased my creativity in an engaging manner using Three.js.
